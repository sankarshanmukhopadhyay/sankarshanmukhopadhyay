# Sankarshan Mukhopadhyay

I build **digital trust infrastructure**: governance patterns, assurance tooling, and interoperable artifacts for real institutions shipping real systems.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- **Verifiable data + identity** (credentials, registries, trust lists)  
- **Assurance + conformance** (testability, evidence bundles, auditability)  
- **AI governance** (operational artifacts, risk-tier bindings, runtime controls)  

Contributor across **Trust Over IP (ToIP)** and adjacent standards ecosystems, with a practical bias: if it cannot be implemented and tested, it is just vibes.

## What I’m focused on right now

### 1) TRQP adoption + assurance front door

A coherent, non-monorepo pathway for teams adopting TRQP with compatibility and combined assurance workflows.

- **TRQP Assurance Hub**

- **TRQP Conformance Suite**

- **TRQP-TSPP**

### 2) DPI + AI governance as artifacts, not opinions

Turning AI governance into reusable packs: templates, matrices, control bindings, and repeatable review methods.

- **DPI AI Governance Lab**

### 3) Agent identity + name assurance

Normative baselines and security profiles that reduce adoption risk and shorten verification cycles.

## Collaboration model

If you are:

- implementing TRQP or trust registries  
- building assurance pipelines for verifiable data  
- operationalizing AI governance in DPI or public systems  

Open a GitHub issue with:

1. Your use case in one paragraph  
2. Your constraints (policy, latency, budget, legal, ecosystem)  
3. The definition of done you can actually ship  

I prefer small, testable increments over big rewrites. High signal beats high ceremony.
