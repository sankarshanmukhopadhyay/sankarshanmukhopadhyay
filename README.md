# Sankarshan Mukhopadhyay

I build **digital trust infrastructure**: governance patterns, assurance tooling, and interoperable artifacts for **real institutions** shipping real systems.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- **Verifiable data + identity** (credentials, registries, trust lists)
- **Assurance + conformance** (testability, evidence bundles, auditability)
- **AI governance** (operational artifacts, risk-tier bindings, runtime controls)

Contributor across **Trust Over IP (ToIP)** and standards ecosystems, with a practical bias: *if it can’t be implemented and tested, it’s just vibes.*

## What I’m focused on right now

### 1) TRQP adoption + assurance “front door”
A coherent, non-monorepo pathway for teams adopting TRQP with compatibility and combined assurance workflows.

- **TRQP Assurance Hub** — onboarding, terminology, compatibility matrix, and cross-repo issue routing  
  → https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/trqp-assurance-hub :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **TRQP Conformance Suite** — deterministic validation + lifecycle/security testing with audit-ready evidence  
  → https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/trqp-conformance-suite :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **TRQP-TSPP** — operationalizes TRQP with a Trust Service Provider Profile overlay  
  → https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/TRQP-TSPP :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

### 2) DPI + AI governance as *artifacts*, not opinions
Turning “AI governance” into reusable packs: templates, matrices, control bindings, and repeatable review methods.

- **DPI AI Governance Artifacts** — governance-ready artifacts for DPI + AI systems  
  → https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/dpi-ai-governance-artifacts :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **DPI AI Governance Lab** — structured critiques, risk matrices, and reproducible analysis workflows  
  → https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/dpi-ai-governance-lab :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

### 3) Agent identity + name assurance (because agents will ship whether we like it or not)
Normative baselines and security profiles that reduce adoption risk and shorten verification cycles.

- **Agent Name Assurance Baseline** — verification tiers, controls, safeguards, and conformance profiles  
  → https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/agent-name-assurance-baseline :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **ERC-8004 CSP** — consumer-side security profile for “trustless agents” metadata + integrity validation  
  → https://github.com/sankarshanmukhopadhyay/ERC-8004-CSP :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Collaboration model (how to engage without chaos)

If you’re:
- implementing TRQP or trust registries,
- building assurance pipelines for verifiable data,
- trying to operationalize AI governance in DPI / public systems,

…open a GitHub issue with:
1) your use case in one paragraph  
2) your constraints (policy, latency, budget, legal, ecosystem)  
3) the “definition of done” you can actually ship

I prefer **small, testable increments** over big rewrites. High signal beats high ceremony.
